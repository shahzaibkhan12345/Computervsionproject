# Face Detection System

This project is a real-time face detection system that uses a webcam to capture video and the YOLOv8 model to identify and draw bounding boxes around faces.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* Ultralytics

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face-Detection-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face-Detection-System
   ```
3. Run the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Press the 'q' key to stop the application.

## Model

This project uses the `yolov8n.pt` model, a pre-trained model from the YOLOv8 series.
